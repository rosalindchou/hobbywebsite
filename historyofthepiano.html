<h2>History of the Piano</h2>

<p>The history of the piano started in the year 1698, when Italian harpsichord maker 
Bartolomeo di Francesco Cristofori constructed the first piano. As a 316-year-old instrument, 
the piano is actually a comparatively new instrument when put next to the forty-thousand-year-old
flute. Still, it is a beautiful instrument that has a fascinating history.</p>
<p><img src="bartolomeocristofori.jpg" style="width:40%">Bartolomeo 
Cristofori was born in 1655 in Padua, Italy and died in the year of 
1731 in Florence, Italy. During his lifetime, he owned a musical instrument shop, where he 
had a collection of stringed instruments. Before Cristofori's invention of the piano, many 
keyboard instruments were already invented from the 14th century in Europe, and had paved 
the pathway for the development of the piano. In fact, the earliest keyboard was the dulcimer, 
which then was further improved to become the clavichord, and soon after came the spinet, virginal, 
clavecin, followed by the gravicembalo, and eventually they landed in the 15th century with 
the harpsichord. <br>If we go all the way back into ancient history, 
mankind had already found that sound can be produced by vibrating strings, and had created 
string instruments that were plucked or bowed. In addition, they had stretched 
and tied strings over boxes using pegs in order to increase the sound of their creations. 
<br>Now back to the keyboards, there was a problem with the harpsichord, which was that it 
could only be played at one volume, and the piano player couldn't control whether he wanted 
to play more quietly or more loudly. Because of this problem, Cristofori was motivated to 
invent the piano, an instrument where the force with which you press the keys can affect the 
volume of sound. <br>After Bartolomeo Cristofori's invention was created, it was first 
displayed as the "gravicembalo col piano e forte" in 1709. Later on, the name was shortened 
"fortepiano", and then further simplified to just "piano". <br>Fun Fact! The oldest piano 
that still exists today is one from 1720 and can be found in the Metropolitan Museum of Art 
in NYC.</p>
