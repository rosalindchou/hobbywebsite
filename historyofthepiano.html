<h2>History of the Piano</h2>

<p>The history of the piano started in the year 1698, when Italian harpsichord maker 
Bartolomeo di Francesco Cristofori constructed the first piano. As a 316-year-old instrument, 
the piano is actually a comparatively new instrument when put next to the forty-thousand-year-old
flute. Still, it is a beautiful instrument that has a fascinating history. <br>Bartolomeo 
Cristofori was born in 1655 in Padua, Italy and died in the year of 
1731 in Florence, Italy. During his lifetime, he owned a musical instrument shop, where he 
had a collection of stringed instruments. Before Cristofori's invention of the piano, many 
keyboard instruments were already invented from the 14th century in Europe, and had paved 
the pathway for the development of the piano. In fact, the earliest keyboard was the dulcimer, 
which then was further improved to become the clavichord, and soon after came the spinet, virginal, 
clavecin, followed by the gravicembalo, and eventually they landed in the 15th century with 
the harpsichord. <br>If we go all the way back into ancient history, 
mankind had already found that sound can be produced by vibrating strings, and had created 
string instruments that were plucked or bowed. In addition, they had stretched 
and tied strings over boxes using pegs in order to increase the sound of their creations.


<p>
The harpsichord, however, was limited to one, unvarying volume. Its softness and loudness could
 not be varied while playing. Therefore, performing artists could not convey the same degree of 
 musical expression as that of most other instruments. The artistic desire for more controlled 
 expression led directly to the invention of the piano, on which the artist could alter the 
 loudness and tone with the force of one’s fingers.

The harpsichord was a particularly important development leading to the invention of the piano. 
Its ability to project sound more loudly than its predecessors, and refinements in the action 
(or touch) inspired many more musicians to compose for the keyboard and thus, to perform keyboard works.

First exhibited in Florence in 1709, Cristofori’s new instrument was named gravicembalo col 
piano e forte (roughly “soft and loud keyboard instrument”). Eventually, it was shortened to 
fortepiano or pianoforte, and finally just piano. His earliest surviving instrument dates from
 1720 and is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

Despite many improvements during the past 300 years, it is truly astonishing to observe how 
similar Cristofori’s instruments are to the modern piano of today.
